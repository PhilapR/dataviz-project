The most up to data vizhub can be found [here](https://vizhub.com/PhilapR/29ef06d19a8847699f7199f1cd7582b2)

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is NBA career statistics.

## Prototypes

The following shows 10 players and how long they played for. Further filtering and grouping needs to be applied.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * What players had the best per-game stats?
 * Are those players consistantly the best across stats?
 * What era of players lasted the longest in the NBA?
 * Are there statistics that are indicitive of when a player played?

## Comments and State of the Project

This iteration added frist included a lot of back end cleaning and preparation of data. Then I was able to add a dropdown that allows the viewer to select the stat they are interested in viewing. For now it is stuck sorted by points. A few issues are present first off all active players are treated differently than retired players. Their data is from the last season while retired players have their career stats. I will be adding a toggle to look at past season vs retired players. Unfortunatly this messes with some of the analysis I wanted to do but Ill adapt. I also want to add a slider that allows you to choose the years to look at.
