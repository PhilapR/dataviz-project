# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is NBA career statistics.

## Prototypes

The following shows 10 players and how long they played for. Further filtering and grouping needs to be applied.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

 * What players had the best per-game stats?
 * Are those players the same as the record holders?
 * What era of players lasted the longest in the NBA?
 * Are there statistics that are indicitive of when a player played?

## Open Questions

I need to organize the data better, I have it collected but is a bit of a mess. The others datasets I was playing around were pretty lack luster when it came to the numbers.
